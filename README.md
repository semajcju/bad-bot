 # I dislike people

And I hate being pinged on discord by random people.

Now you could just limit there permissions so they don't have access to that ping however I want to teach these people a lesson.

There is no better way to do this than with this bot.

To invite this to your own server then go to the top.gg [link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) (the top.gg link hasn't been verified yet and there is currently no way to add this bot to your server without hosting it yourself)
